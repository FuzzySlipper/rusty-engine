# C# SDK guide

This guide describes the C# surface that exists today. It distinguishes that
surface from recommended product organization so an agent does not mistake a
proposal for an API.

## Build a product through the generated surface

`Rusty.Engine` is the public C# dependency. Its project invokes
[`generate-csharp-native-bindings.sh`](../scripts/generate-csharp-native-bindings.sh)
and compiles generated safe contracts and values from `obj/Generated`.
`Rusty.Engine.ProductGenerator` is an analyzer/source-generator dependency of a
NativeAOT composition project. It emits the internal native bootstrap and safe
service implementations.

An ordinary product project should:

1. reference [`Rusty.Engine`](../csharp/Rusty.Engine),
2. implement generated `IEngineProduct`,
3. accept `ProductCreateContext` in its product constructor,
4. keep an `IEngineContext` or only the named services it needs,
5. select exactly one product with `[assembly: EngineProduct(typeof(...))]` in
   the composition project, and
6. let the generator supply exports and interop code.

The fixture's [`Product.cs`](../fixtures/csharp-nativeaot-trial/Product.cs) and
[`NativeProduct.cs`](../fixtures/csharp-nativeaot-trial/NativeProduct.cs) show
the smallest current reference. The fixture's broad capability exercise is
intentional proof scaffolding; a normal product should use only the service
families it needs.

## Current lifecycle

The generated `IEngineProduct` contract has lifecycle callbacks for `Start`,
`Update`, `Pause`, `Resume`, `Restart`, `Shutdown`, and `Dispose`. Its optional
`CompleteTimeline` callback receives copied, host-admitted completion data and
lets product code accept or reject the product-owned ticket meaning.

- The constructor receives `ProductCreateContext`, including `IEngineContext`,
  admitted product content, and input configuration.
- `Update(ProductUpdate)` receives Engine-owned update facts and copied input
  events, then returns `ProductUpdateResult` when it needs a supported host
  action.
- `ProductCreateContext.Debugging.Snapshot` retains the latest committed
  Rust-owned lifecycle state and runtime binding, including host-only fault and
  control transitions. Its optional latest-update facts remain the last copied
  update delivery rather than a fabricated host callback.
- The runtime, not the product, drives lifecycle transitions and owns host
  integration. Do not create another central game loop or advance Engine time
  yourself.
- Timeline completion is binding-fenced by the Rust runtime before C# receives
  it. Correlation, outcome, and provenance values are copied into safe managed
  data; a product that does not own timeline tickets may leave the default
  rejecting implementation in place.

A product callback is not a transaction over every Engine service. Each
generated service operation preserves its own validation and failure
atomicity, while only service families that explicitly stage call output are
committed or discarded with the outer callback. Mutable `Spatial` and `Voxel`
operations commit immediately: if one succeeds and product code or a later
Engine call fails, the earlier mutation remains authoritative. Validate
product policy before issuing mutations, retain returned revisions/receipts,
and make retry behavior explicit. Use a named prepared/commit API when a
multi-owner change genuinely requires coordination; do not assume an exception
rewinds an Engine world.

Current `IEngineContext` properties are named service families generated from
the ABI: look, dynamics, motion, kinematic, spatial, perception, world origin,
voxel, voxel content and presentation, content, authored content, appearance,
presentation, animation, audio, camera view, random, persistence, content
store, and UI. The exact method set is defined by the current generated
`Rusty.Engine` output and Rust ABI source. Mechanics, resolution, and state
machines are ordinary managed helpers, not native context services. See the
[current capability map](csharp-capabilities.md) and do not assume a Rust API
is callable from C# simply because its crate is public.

### Atlas sprite playback

`Appearance.CreateSpritePlayback` retains one admitted sequence for an
atlas-backed sprite. `SelectSpritePlaybackFrame` selects the start of an exact
sequence entry and atomically updates both the playback readout and rendered
sprite frame. It preserves stopped, playing, or paused state; a completed
one-shot becomes paused so it can resume from the selected entry. Selection
does not wrap an out-of-range index, change the current loop cycle, or report
marker crossings because it does not traverse time. A later
`AdvanceSpritePlayback` continues from the selected cursor through the ordinary
Engine-admitted update facts.

### Ghost plates

`IEngineContext.Presentation` provides the retained ghost-plate path. Create a
plate from the stable object ID of a retained Engine `Appearance`, then let the
product choose its placement, capture/framing/lighting settings, plate
mapping, depth/shell settings, and directional profile. The profile supports
1, 4, 8, or 16 captures with hysteresis; sector changes are Engine-owned hard
snaps. `UpdateGhostPlate` changes placement/configuration and
`RecaptureGhostPlate` replaces capture settings. Dispose the returned
`GhostPlatePresentation` before its source Appearance is released.

The Engine retains the cloned capture bank, textures, renderer realization,
and disposal. `ReadGhostPlate` returns copied facts rather than renderer
objects: source presence and match, whether a host observation exists,
fallback/limitation facts, current sector and offset, the effective
capture/configuration, and retained resource counts/timing when the host
provides them. The capture freezes the source Appearance pose, so this is a
bounded presentation mechanism rather than live animation or a second
renderer.

### Microvoxel objects

`IEngineContext.VoxelContent.AdmitMagicaVoxelObject` is the direct small-object
path. It admits bounded MagicaVoxel v150 model bytes with product-selected
identity, source path, cell size, pivot, orientation, and limits. Read the
copied palette/object facts, bind every admitted palette slot to an ordinary
`Appearance` material (roughness 1 is a suitable matte starting point), and
call `ProjectObject` to obtain a retained `VoxelObjectPresentation`. Use the
generated update operation for frame, transform, and visibility changes, then
dispose the presentation and object handles normally.

The default object mesh is a greedy voxel surface with axis-aligned face
normals. This route uses ordinary Engine materials and retained mesh resources;
it does not require voxel-specific shaders, a browser renderer, or TypeScript
game code. It remains bounded by source, dimension, voxel, frame, mesh, and
material limits, and it is not a general scene import path. Unsupported source
or presentation needs are an upstream Engine task and a valid stopping point.

`VoxelScenePresentation` projects the canonical `Spatial` session voxel scene
through the Engine renderer. Bind every currently used scene material slot to
a live `Appearance` material, retain the disposable projection, and call
`RefreshScene` after voxel edits, residency changes, or origin changes. The
Engine keeps incremental renderer identity and owns all generated mesh/frame
work; C# receives only a small readout. `Clear` or disposal stages the matching
renderer destroys. Select `VoxelSurfaceMode` in `SpatialSessionConfig` when
creating the session; it chooses only the Engine-derived mesh posture and is
retained through subsequent voxel changes. Changing the mode of an existing
session is not currently a C# API.

`Spatial.EvaluateNavigationStep` evaluates one bounded planar-navigation step
against the retained session projection and returns the same typed outcome,
next-waypoint, path-cell, and path facts as `ProposeNavigationStep`. Evaluation
does not update the retained navigation path, revisions, projections, or other
session state, so product code can use its facts before deciding whether to
issue a separate stateful operation. `ProposeNavigationStep` remains the
stateful path proposal and updates the retained path on success or clears it
for its existing failure outcomes.

Spatial trigger definitions remain registered for the session while their
active state can change. `SetTriggerActive` is revision-guarded: deactivation
removes current overlaps and publishes bounded exit facts, while reactivation
publishes no synthetic enter—the next ordinary `ReconcileTriggers` observes
real geometry and produces any new edge. `RestoreTriggers` accepts the complete
active trigger ID set plus current projected colliders and replaces the active
and overlap baseline without producing gameplay facts. Use `ReadTrigger` for
the current active flag, revision, and overlap count, and consume facts only up
to the count returned by the operation receipt. Unknown IDs, duplicate state
changes, duplicate restore IDs, and stale revisions reject without changing
the session. Disposing the Spatial session destroys the definitions, active
set, overlaps, and fact history together.

Use `Spatial.ReplaceContentArtifact` when offline conversion has already
published the canonical collision/navigation JSON through Engine Content. The
Engine resolves the retained `ContentReference`, validates and copies its
bounded geometry and signed multilevel navigation facts, and replaces both
projections as one operation. The returned digest, revisions, counts, and
projection hashes—and `ReadContentArtifact`—identify the admitted source.
Products still choose the content and navigation grid policy; they do not read
the bytes, rebuild raw array requests, or infer collision from a visual mesh.

`CharacterStepRequest.Obstacles` is a borrowed, call-local list of active
product-authored colliders. Give each obstacle its stable entity identity,
current transform, local bounds, collision participation, and motion facts;
the Engine uses them for the one controller proposal and returns ordinary
`CharacterMotion`, `CharacterSupport`, and platform facts. Resubmit the
current support transform and obstacle list on later steps so Engine-owned
support/carry continuation can apply; the session never retains product
entities or collider records. Collision uses the existing translation-offset
AABB posture with unit scale; obstacle rotation participates in platform carry
but does not rotate the collider volume.

To save an admitted character continuation, call
`CaptureCharacterContinuation` with the latest `CharacterStepReceipt.Generation`
and persist the copied `CharacterContinuationCheckpoint` beside the
product-owned pose and look. After recreating a compatible `SpatialSession`
and its canonical content, call `RestoreCharacterContinuation`; use its
returned `Motion` and the checkpoint's `Config` for the next
`ProposeCharacterStep`, while supplying current product-authored support and
obstacle facts as usual. The Engine rejects stale source generations, invalid
motion, changed session configuration, and changed canonical content before
returning a continuation. A checkpoint is a plain value, not a session lease;
it cannot restore into a disposed or already-used target session. Its source
session identity and generation are copied diagnostic provenance, not a native
handle that remains resolvable after save/load; target compatibility comes from
the typed configuration, motion, session, and canonical-content checks.

## Values, leases, and native lifetime

The public C# layer turns direct service calls into typed requests, receipts,
values, and disposable handles. Follow the type's ownership model:

- Use returned value records directly or copy their data when you need to keep
  it.
- Dispose values that represent an Engine lease, session, snapshot, resource,
  or handle when their scope ends. `using` is the usual product-side shape.
- Do not retain borrowed spans, native pointers, or callback-backed data beyond
  their stated call/lease lifetime.
- Do not add unsafe code, handwritten P/Invoke, ABI structs, or
  `UnmanagedCallersOnly` exports to normal product code. The generator owns
  those details.

The product boundary is trusted, but these memory and lifetime rules are real
correctness requirements rather than policy ceremony.

## Optional managed helper packages

These packages are current reusable helpers, not required product framework
pieces:

| Package | Current role |
| --- | --- |
| [`Rusty.Engine.Application`](../csharp/Rusty.Engine/Application) | An optional Engine-context update pipeline and deterministic scheduler helper, compiled into `Rusty.Engine`. Its `SimulationScheduler` can resume on the next admitted step, wait fixed admitted steps, or wait for a caller-owned completion condition without creating a second clock. |
| [`Rusty.Engine.Entities`](../csharp/Rusty.Engine/Entities) | Product component keys, managed entity worlds, snapshots, batches, and managed adapters around Engine mechanisms, compiled into `Rusty.Engine`. |
| [`Rusty.Engine.Persistence`](../csharp/Rusty.Engine/Persistence) | Product-state codecs, stores, restoration plans, and entity-world persistence helpers, compiled into `Rusty.Engine`. |
| [`Rusty.Engine.Resolution`](../csharp/Rusty.Engine/Resolution) | Structural resolution sessions and typed product transaction coordination inside the default `Rusty.Engine` assembly. |

Use a helper when it fits the product's real domain. A product may compose its
own ordinary C# architecture instead. None of these packages implies a hidden
`ProductApplication`, `ProductBuilder`, `IProductModule`, analyzer suite,
typed-content framework, or projection framework: those names are not current
SDK APIs.

## Recommended product architecture, not a framework contract

[C# product style](csharp-product-style.md) recommends organizing product code
by domain modules, keeping state ownership explicit, and using thin
Read/Decide/Apply/Publish coordinators. These are conventions a product can
adopt directly; they do not require registration APIs or runtime discovery.

For gameplay that needs Engine infrastructure, combine the ordinary managed
helpers with named generated service calls rather than reimplementing native
mechanisms downstream. Product rules, state transitions, and orchestration are
ordinary C# concerns.

## Missing capability workflow

If the needed behavior cannot be expressed through the generated API:

1. identify the missing Engine mechanism and the lifecycle point it needs;
2. record the concrete product call shape or fact the mechanism should admit;
3. file or link the narrow Engine task when authorized; and
4. stop the downstream substitution work.

Do not bypass the gap with a browser renderer, TypeScript gameplay path,
handwritten interop, JSON bridge, or a parallel Rust implementation in the
product repository. The inability to proceed is useful evidence for the
upstream capability work.
